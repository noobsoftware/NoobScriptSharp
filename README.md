# NoobScriptSharp
NoobScript C# version

This is the C# / .NET version of NoobScript. Differs from the mac version in some minor ways, for example requiring increaseing the stack size for multithreading functionality, due to limitations and differences in the coding.

NoobScript has a PHP / JavaScript-like syntax with support for callbacks, multithreading. Differs from PHP in some ways, for example all arrays are passed by reference. Uses the "async" keyword for multithreaded functions. Have a look at https://github.com/noobsoftware/NoobMusic3/ for general reference for NoobScript and coding styles for NoobScript code.
